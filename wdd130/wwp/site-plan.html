      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>For decades, people have been going to the market to buy food stuff and other items. That takes a lot of time from your home to the market location. A lot of energy is spent every day going through market sections to look and grab different items. Now, this is over. From your home you can find and get all you need from any market in your area through a mobile app. Market Delivery Service (MDS) does all that for you in a reasonable amount of time. We help you save your time and your energy so that you can focus on more important things.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>It is time consuming and energy consuming to go to the market and get what we need for the day or week. Both people with disabilities and those with all their abilities may be struggling with that as it requires some significant efforts from them. Some struggle with it due to their busy schedule. We can all be relieved now, and not be worried about putting in more energy or time to get stuff of necessity at your home.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Our Services</h3>
      <p>
        Our services are divided into two segments. The ordering segment consists of ordering all the items you need on our websites. On the website, you can find all the items that are in any grocery store or mall. The delivering segment is the second one. It is the most important of both. From the website, you can ask our services to pick up and deliver to your desired location the items that you have already ordered from a store. Those stores do not have to be one of our partners. This segment is not dependent on the first segment. However, when you order the items, you get the delivery service in the package.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first segment, our team gathers the information from your order. They get the items on it in one of our partnersâ€™ malls, package it, and make sure your orders get to you in a reasonable amount of time. The second segment gets all your orders at your indicated location and gets them to you. We work closely with the information you provided to make sure your delivery is properly done.
